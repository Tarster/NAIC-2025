However, professional fee benefit as set out in the Schedule of Benefits for Professional Fees is payable for out-patient\\nprocedures with the exception of out-patient radiotherapy. c) Day-to-day Medical Expenses benefit\\nDay-to-Day Medical Expenses benefit is payable for treatment as specified in Sections 9 and 10 of your Table of Benefits. d) General conditions We will pay benefits for in-patient and day-patient treatment, side room procedures and out-patient procedures, for a\\nmaximum of 180 days per member in any calendar year, less any days treatment within the same calendar year which\\nhas been paid under any other health insurance contract (for benefit in respect of psychiatric treatment and substance\\nabuse, please refer to Rules 6(r) and 6(s)). e) The benefits which we will pay will depend on the terms of your contract on:\\n(i) the first day of a hospital stay or (ii) the date of the treatment if the member is not staying in hospital. f) If the benefits do not cover the full cost of the treatment, the member is responsible for any balance. g) We will pay the actual amount the member is charged or the benefits payable under the contract, whichever is lower. h) If you use hospital accommodation which requires a higher level of cover than you hold under your plan, the level of\\nbenefits payable will be as outlined in your Table of Benefits. Where a hospital is not listed in the Directory of Hospitals (and Treatment Centres), no benefit will be payable. i) Day care procedures Hospital benefit is payable for specified day care procedures carried out in a Vhi Healthcare approved day care facility\\nlisted in the Directory of Hospitals (and Treatment Centres) and which is covered by your plan. If the day care procedures\\nare performed in an in-patient setting (private, semi-private or public ward) the approved day care charges only are\\npayable. If it is medically necessary for the member to receive the treatment as an in-patient, we will pay the full benefits\\nfor the hospital charges in accordance with the level of cover under your plan. j) Side room procedures Hospital benefit is payable for side room procedures carried out in a Vhi Healthcare approved hospital listed in the\\nDirectory of Hospitals (and Treatment Centres) and which is covered by your plan. If it is medically necessary for the\\nmember to receive the treatment as a day-patient or as an in-patient, we will pay the full benefits for the hospital\\ncharges in accordance with the level of cover under your plan. k) Out-patient Procedures Vhi Healthcare benefit is payable for out-patient procedures carried out on an out-patient basis. Where an out-patient\\nprocedure is carried out in a hospital which is not covered by your plan, professional fee benefit is in accordance with\\nRule 6(b), however hospital charges are not eligible for benefit. No benefit is payable for Out-patient Radiotherapy\\ncarried out in a hospital, which is not covered by your plan. l) Fixed Price Procedures (FPPs)\\nWe will provide the benefit set out in Section 1 of your Table of Benefits for Fixed Price Procedures. Under Company Plan, no benefit is payable for non-Cardiac Fixed Price Procedures even if: a) it is a result of an\\nemergency; or b) ongoing care during a planned admission results in charges for an unplanned FPP; or c) charges arising\\nfor complications directly as a result of a cardiac FPP during subsequent hospital stays; or d) the admission is subsequent\\nto a previous non-FPP admission for which benefit was paid. It is important to note that these procedures are available in hospitals other than the Beacon Hospital, Blackrock Clinic,\\nMater Private Hospital and Galway Clinic. However, when they are carried out in other hospitals they are not called Fixed\\nPrice Procedures and in these circumstances benefit is payable in accordance with the benefits associated with your level\\nof cover for these hospitals, as set out in your Table of Benefits, and not as a Fixed Price Procedure. 5\\n=== companyPlan_Rules_Apr10.pdf — Page 6 ===\\nIf you are in any doubt about the level of cover payable in respect of any procedure or treatment, we recommend that\\nyou contact us prior to admission. m)MRI Scans In-patient MRI scans\\nIf the patient, during the course of a medically necessary stay in a participating hospital listed in the Directory of\\nHospitals (and Treatment Centres) which is covered by your plan and for which hospital benefit is payable, has an eligible\\nMRI scan performed in an approved MRI centre listed in the Directory of Approved MRI Centres and covered by your\\nplan, we will pay the benefit set out in Section 8 of your Table of Benefits.

A list of the approved clinical indications for\\nwhich benefit is payable appears at the back of this Rules document. In respect of ‘Out-patient MRI Scans – Category 2’, the benefit for the consultant’s fee is subject to a maximum of the\\nparticipating benefit listed in the Vhi Healthcare Schedule of Benefits for Professional Fees. If the patient attends as an out-patient, an Approved MRI Centre that is not listed in the Directory of Approved MRI\\nCentres as ’Out-patient MRI Scans - Category 1’, ’Out-patient MRI Scans - Category 2’, or ’Out-patient MRI Scans -\\nCategory 3’, no benefit is payable for either the hospital charge or the consultant’s fee. n) Convalescent Care All Plans (excluding Company Plan Executive)\\nWe will pay the benefit listed in Section 5 of your Table of Benefits towards convalescent care where each of the\\nfollowing is satisfied in full:\\n(i) If the consultant decides and our Medical Director agrees, that it is necessary for medical reasons for a member to\\nreceive convalescent care in a Convalescent Home;\\n(ii) If the stay in the Convalescent Home is immediately after a medically necessary stay in hospital which is eligible for\\nVhi Healthcare benefit, even if the hospital is not covered by your plan;\\n(iii) If the member occupies single room accommodation in a Convalescent Home listed in Vhi Healthcare’s Directory of\\nConvalescent Homes.

They are divided into different sections mainly due to how they are claimed or\\nthe type of expenses covered. The following sections of this Membership Handbook explain the different types of benefits offered by us. Within each section is a table which lists our\\nbenefits, shows the terms and conditions that apply to each benefit, and tells you how to claim it. Please note that all these benefits may not be available under your plan. You should check your Table of Cover to see which benefits apply to you\\nand how much you can claim under each benefit. You will also be able to see on your Table of Cover if an excess or shortfall applies. How our benefits are categorised can change on different plans, so you may notice that some of your benefits appear in different sections in this\\nMembership Handbook and on your Table of Cover. If a benefit listed in your Table of Cover is not explained in the corresponding table in this Membership\\nHandbook, please check the tables in other sections of this Membership Handbook. The terms and conditions that apply to our benefits (as described in\\nthe tables below) will always apply even if the benefit is positioned in a different section of your Table of Cover. If a day-to-day excess applies to your plan, this will always affect all the benefits included in that section of your Table of Cover. It doesn’t matter if one\\nor more of your Day-to-day Benefits appear in a different section in this Membership Handbook. You will always be covered to the level of cover set out in the Minimum Benefit Regulations for the applicable medical services listed in those regulations\\n(subject to any waiting periods). Please see section 6 and the Definitions section of this Membership Handbook for an explanation of the Minimum\\nBenefit Regulations. We will always deduct any withholding tax or other deductions required by law before paying your claim. 2.1 DAY-TO-DAY BENEFITS\\nThese benefits typically allow you to claim a contribution from us towards visits to certain medical practitioners or for certain medical services. The\\namounts that can be claimed and frequency or number of visits they apply to are set out in your Table of Cover. Where contributions are listed as a\\nsingle amount, they are claimable once per policy year unless otherwise stated. Please see the “How to calculate your cover under your Day-To-Day\\nBenefits” section below for details on how you may be covered under these benefits. You can claim these benefits for medical services received in Ireland\\nor when you are abroad. There may be instances where benefits in different sections of your Table of Cover apply to the same medical expenses. In this instance when claiming\\nonline, please check your Table of Cover to choose the section you wish to claim under. You cannot claim for the same medical expenses twice.

What is Specified Illness Cover? Specified Illness Cover is a benefit which pays a one-off\\nlump sum if you are diagnosed with one of the specific\\nillnesses covered under your plan. Typically, the major\\nconditions covered include certain types of malignant\\ncancer, diagnosed heart attack, stroke with permanent\\nsymptoms and multiple sclerosis. Each illness is defined in\\nyour plan terms and conditions. === guide-to-specified-illness-claims.pdf — Page 6 ===\\n4\\n2\\nThe claim process\\n=== guide-to-specified-illness-claims.pdf — Page 7 ===\\n5\\nTHE CLAIM PROCESS\\nHow do I make a claim?

My policy has a $2,500 deductible that I haven't met, plus a separate $500 specialty device deductible. The CGM costs $200/month, but there's also a one-time $800 setup fee. My plan covers durable medical equipment at 80% after deductible, but I'm not sure if CGM qualifies as DME or if it falls under prescription benefits which have different copay tiers.

      "Question: My claim for bariatric surgery was initially denied because the insurer says I didn't meet the 6-month supervised diet requirement, but my previous insurer's records show I completed 4 months before switching jobs. My new employer's plan has a different BMI threshold (35 vs 40) and my BMI is 37. Can I appeal using records from my previous coverage, and if my spouse's plan would cover this procedure, how does coordination of benefits work when one plan covers and the other denies the same service?\n",
      "Answer: content=\"Based on the provided policy context, here’s how your situation regarding the appeal for bariatric surgery can be analyzed:\\n\\n1. **Appealing the Claim Denial**: You can appeal the decision made on your claim by writing to the insurer and outlining the reasons for your appeal. You should include any additional information that you believe is relevant, such as the records from your previous insurer showing that you completed 4 months of a supervised diet. The policy states that your claim file will be reviewed in full by another claims assessor, and an appeal decision will be issued to you (see **guide-to-specified-illness-claims.pdf — Page 10**).\\n\\n2. **BMI Thresholds**: The difference in BMI thresholds between your previous and current plans (35 vs. 40) is significant. Since your current BMI is 37, it meets the requirement of the previous plan but not the current one. This could be a point of contention in your appeal, as the insurer may argue that you do not meet their current criteria. However, presenting evidence of your previous coverage and compliance with their requirements may strengthen your case.\\n\\n3. **Coordination of Benefits**: If your spouse's plan covers the bariatric surgery while your current plan denies it, coordination of benefits will come into play. Typically, when two insurance plans are involved, the primary plan (the one that covers you as the insured) pays first, and the secondary plan (your spouse's plan) may cover some or all of the remaining costs, depending on its terms. You should check both plans' coordination of benefits clauses to understand how they interact. The policy does not provide specific details on coordination of benefits, so you may need to contact the insurers directly for clarification on how they handle situations where one plan covers a service and the other does not.\\n\\n4. **Conditions and Exclusions**: It is important to note that if your current plan has specific exclusions or conditions regarding bariatric surgery, these will need to be addressed in your appeal. If the surgery is not covered under your current plan due to these exclusions, it may complicate your appeal process (see **guide-to-specified-illness-claims.pdf — Page 10**).\\n\\nIn summary, you can appeal the denial using your previous insurer's records, but be prepared for the challenges posed by the different BMI thresholds and any exclusions in your current plan. Coordination of benefits will allow you to potentially utilize your spouse's plan for coverage, but you will need to clarify how both plans will interact.\" additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 510, 'prompt_tokens': 5477, 'total_tokens': 5987, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_8bda4d3a2c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-CBtDEEb79VOPhWZPsZddCk33AuF5Z', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--01329029-1e46-47c1-9ae3-ae4184223282-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 5477, 'output_tokens': 510, 'total_tokens': 5987, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n",
